# IntelliJ JVM arguments setter plugin

This plugin allows you to easily set JVM arguments globally across all your run configurations in IntelliJ.

This plugin is not currently on the marketplace and has to be installed manually.

Forked from this project [global-jvm-param](https://github.com/codecly259/global-jvm-param) thanks to codecly259 for adding a proper license for extension!
